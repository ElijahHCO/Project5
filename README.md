# project5

For my fifth and final GA project. I plan to continue working on my SnowShelves app.
I will move my Project4 version to my Project3 Express version

Goals(Requirements):
Update Project3 to reflect Project4 X
Add User/Auth Login
Make the Location Display location.name instead of location._id


Stretch Goals:
Add a Type Model
Refine Styling
Make a Sort Option
Design a Sort/Search Box
Purchase a Legit Domain



With SnowShelves(Project5) I have converted my Project3 to reflect Project4 and added a couple new features. 

I have added the Location.name display to each item, as well as,  a login/logout feature to secure the data. 

In the future i hope to come back and fully authenticate the login/logout process, and to redesign the layout completely.
I would say the app is still in a develeopment stage for sure.

I am happy with my progress on this project and plan to add it to the portfolio tomorrow.
